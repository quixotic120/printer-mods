fan shroud

had a heck of a time finding a replacement shroud for dual e3dv6. I broke both of the 30mm fans because they are kind of crappy. I had no 30mm fans on hand but I did have a 40mm. I found [this](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1065471/) which cools both with one 40mm fan and liked the design. Printed it and it was slightly too large but luckily he shared the IPT and I was able to modify to fit snugly. Still not sold on using one 40mm fan for both extruders but it appears to be as good as the two 30mm fans (still cool to the touch even when running 250C). Printed in ABS with 20% infill. The original STL prints fine but mine had some issues with the fins I added; you may have to play with it a bit. 

While I was at it I added a guard so I (hopefully) stop breaking fans. I like [this customizable one](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:128718)
