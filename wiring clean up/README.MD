Wiring

any suggestions to improve here are greatly appreciated! I’ve cleaned it up quite a bit but it’s still a bit of a mess, especially around the RAMPS board.

some notes:
if you don’t have them get connector housings (listed as dupont connectors on a lot of sites or “rectangular connector housing”, just make sure it’s not keyed and has a 2.54mm pitch). Theres a ton of excess in the wiring that can be eliminated

suggestions for wiring cleanup (directly at RAMPS board especially) are greatly appreciated
