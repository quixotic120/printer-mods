Don’t have internal pics but can describe the process:

I used [this switch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00511QVVK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s03) with a 10A fuse

looking at [the reverse of the switch](http://www.electro-tech-online.com/customimages/2011/10/2prtgk1-1.jpg) we can see 4 terminals on the switch at the top; label them as such:

1  |  2 
3  |  4

looking at the bottom E - labeled in green in the linked image - is earth and connected directly to earth on the PSU. N and L (black and white) connect to 2 and 4, then 1 and 3 would connect to N and L on the PSU side. 

I printed a random cover I found on thingiverse; can’t find it anymore. It’s slightly too wide anyway. The wires are loomed and come out of a hole; the cover had a bracket built into the loom hole that holds the wires in place with 2 M4 screws. It’s handy but if I were to remake this I would probably just socket the power wires. 

I printed [this mounting bracket](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:46324). It probably works well; I ran out M4 screws which are what my power supply uses. it’ll happen someday.
