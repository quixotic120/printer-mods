very basic but made things a bit more consistent.

drilled out the holes on the limit switches to 3mm (I used 1/8”)- be careful with this as it’s fairly easy to crack the shell and ruin the switch. 

drilled out the zip tie holes on the wood to 3mm as well - I used a 7/64” (~2.7mm) bit so that it was a tight fit.

on the reverse of the wood I drilled the hole out with a countersink. I went until an M3 nut sat fairly flush.  

I only had M3x12 screws which were a touch long - I had extra nuts though so I just placed a second nut under the screw head, screwed through the switch into the wood and then into a nut on the opposite side. 

I found this held it in place much better than the zip tie. As you can see in the attached image I also removed the roller arm. I don’t know if this is necessary in X and Y but before I used ABL I found it was a noticeable improvement in the Z axis. If you do remove them in x and y (y especially) you have to be very careful to ensure the switches are able to triggered.
