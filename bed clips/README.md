borosilicate glass is available in 10”x10” sheets from McMaster-Carr (8476K21) - I scored the edges with a carbide drill bit, wet the score, and the bent the corner away with needle nose pliers. Not the cleanest break but it worked. Sanded lightly after but it didn’t really need it. A bit pricey but super flat and strong.

for the clamps search on thingiverse as there are printable clamps but if you have ring crimps and washers/don’t want a printed part on your hot bed read on

start with [ring crimp connectors](http://www.amazon.com/Shipping-Insulated-Connector-Electrical-Terminal/dp/B00FZK910K/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1452914872&sr=8-7&keywords=crimp+connector+ring).
I dont if these specific ones are good for this, I had some on hand that I had gotten locally. Try to find one that will fit under the M3 head. if not you can put a washer under the head like I did or get an M3 screw with a wider head. a tighter fit would probably be more effective but the added width of the larger crimp is handy. Luckily they’re dirt cheap!

cut off insulation and open crimp end with needle nose pliers. use cutting pliers to remove excess from crimp end, just enough to cross the edge of the glass 1-2mm or so. Bend the crimp end down slightly so it clamps harder.

place a spacer the size of your glass under the crimp. I used a stack of washers because I had a ton on hand and finding heat resistant spacers this small was difficult and/or too expensive to justify). for 3/32” plate glass a few washers will be tall enough, for my 1/8” (~3.175mm) borosilicate I used 4 M5 washers and it’s a touch too short but it works. If you can find a suitable spacer let me know and I’ll appreciate it. For the boro a spacer with 1/8” (~3.2mm) thickness, 1/8” (3.2mm) ID and 5/16” (8mm) to about 3/8” (9.5mm) OD. If the OD is much wider it won’t fit and it also has to be heat resistant to bed temps. I would say ~280F/140C to be safe.

In addition I add mini binder clips (~1/2”/13mm wide) in the spots where binder clips were. I don’t know how necessary this is but I did notice some gaps between the glass and the heated bed and these pulled it all together while taking up way less space than the ones you get from Makerfarm. 

optional: print and add [thumbwheels](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:874155) to the M3 nuts. I think this is extremely helpful to set up the bed; even with auto bed leveling it should be trammed occasionally so that it’s as close as possible. 

With all of this you lose about 10mm from the edges which is way less than the original binder clips. I did this with stuff from my office and workshop so it was essentially free but even buying everything it should only be a few bucks. I noticed that Makerfarm has a printable upgrade that is basically a spacer at the end of the bed - this probably works fine as well but it requires an 11-12” length of glass. I was also wary to have a portion of the glass off the bed; uneven temperature distribution can weaken or break glass.
